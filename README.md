This is the lightcurve repository. 

## LC.py
Initialize a light curve object based on time, flux and flux_error. 
Study its Bayesian block representation based on Scargle et al. 2013 <a>google.com</a>

It allows you to study the Bayesian block representation of light curves and determine their HOP groups as first introduced in Meyer et al. 2019.
